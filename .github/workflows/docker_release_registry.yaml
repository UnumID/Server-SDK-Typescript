# # This workflow will build and push a new container image to the corresponding Github Container Registry.

# # Note the permissions around the private "Github Package Docker Registry" is not granular enough to allow read-only access
# # to pull the image. Instead going to use Deployment Keys on the repo itself to provide read-only access to interested parties.
# # However, there is no way for a entity authorized via a deploy key to pull private images. Leaving this job functional however
# # so CI/CD job to publish the versioned images is ready.
