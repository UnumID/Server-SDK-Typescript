# Unum ID Typescript Server-SDK

This SDK combines the functionality of an [**Issuer**](https://docs.unumid.co/terminology#issuer) and [**Verifier**](https://docs.unumid.co/terminology#verifier) entities to work with UnumID's SaaS. For necessary account creation and API keys please email admin@unumid.co.

## Documentation
High level technical documentation can be found [here](https://docs.unumid.co/server-sdk) which is served via [Docusaurus](https://github.com/UnumID/UnumID.github.io). More detailed generated from source documentation can be found [here](https://docs.unumid.co/Server-SDK-Typescript/index.html) which is served via repo specific Github pages via the /docs folder of the main branch.
## Distribution

This project is publicly published on the official npm [registry](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@unumid/server-sdk). For example it can be pulled with, `npm i @unumid/server-sdk` or `yarn add @unumid/server-sdk`.

## Releases

Releases and publishing to NPM is automated via Github Actions CI job. In order to trigger a release one should push a git tag with a preceding `v` with semver notation, ie `v1.1.1`, to the `main` branch. This will trigger the CI job to bump the package version, generate typedocs, publish to NPM, make a release commit, and make a Github Release. The contents of the Github Release are autogenerated based on pull requests with commits associated with the release, so please use PRs to makes changes to `main`. The message of the git tag will be the commit message for the release so please make it meaningful. For example, `git tag v1.1.1 -m "Updated the SDK with a new CI job" && push origin v1.1.1`.

## Global Dependencies
- NodeJS v14.0.0 or higher, preferably v14.15.0 or higher
- yarn

## Environment Variables
The following environment variables are required to be set to use the SDK properly.
- `UNUM_ENV`
- `LOG_LEVEL`
- `DEBUG`
### UNUM_ENV
One needs to provide the SDK the with an environment variable to denote its run time environment, i.e. `production`. For the Typescript SDK this done via the `UNUM_ENV` environment variable. The three relevant values are: `production`, `sandbox`, `dev`. You need to use one of these exactly in order for the SDK to communicate with Unum ID's SaaS. The default value if nothing is supplied is `sandbox`.

### LOG_LEVEL
The default logs level is `info`. You can change this to `debug` for more information (set the environment variable `LOG_LEVEL = debug`). The logs default to `stdout`, so you can easily aggregate them from disk using the log provider of your choice.

We use standard NPM log levels. Learn more about these [here](https://github.com/winstonjs/winston#logging-levels).

### DEBUG
The `DEBUG` environment variable defaults to `false`. Setting to `true` enables logging of decrypted presentations at the `debug` level. Due to presentations containing potentially sensitive information it is *not* advised to use in a production environment. Note: the `LOG_LEVEL` envirnoment variable also needs to be set to at least `debug` level in order to be visible.

In order to generate the Typedoc documentation from the source code run the `createTypedocs.sh` script.

## Versioning
Information regarding the suggested versioning strategy can be found [here](https://docs.unumid.co/deployment-overview#versioning-strategy).
Breaking versions of this SDK will be denoted as such with an incremented major version. However all versions of the SDK will be fully backwards compatible with the other Unum ID SDKs. If there is a need to referencing an older version of the SDK within your applications for other applications specific backwards compatibility we recommend this syntax for simplicity: 
`@unumid/server-sdk-v2": "npm:@unumid/server-sdk@2.1.4`.


## SDK Functionality
The Server SDK uses the **UnumDto** type to facilitate handling many response body types while providing a reliable structure to access the result body and importantly the rolling JWT authToken.

```typescript title="UnumDto"
{
  "authToken": string; // The JWT auth token which is used by the SDK to authenticate with UnumID's SaaS. This is periodically refreshed thus its value should be read and stored in every resultant function call. 
  "body": T; // The placeholder for the function's response type is function specific. 
}
```

**Authentication**
Every request detailed below requires a Bearer `authToken` as a first parameter which is used to authenticate request to UnumID's SaaS on your behalf. As mention above this auth token updated upon every subsequent function call and should be read via the `authToken` attribute and persisted accordingly for later requests. 

**Errors** 
Errors returned by UnumID's SaaS will also be wrapped in the UnumDto object so that the potentially updated `authToken` can be retrieved. Validation errors which are created prior to any internal calls to UnumID's SaaS will be of type Error and are thrown. This is due to never making a network call with the provided authToken so no potential new authToken to pass back. For this reason we recommend wrapping all SDK calls in a try/catch.
## Issuer
The Issuer functionality is used by a customer acting as an Issuer. It allows customers to perform actions such as issuing and revoking Credentials.

### registerIssuer
Register an issuer corresponding to your customer UUID and issuer API key provided by UnumID. As a customer, you can register as many issuers as you like (or none at all), depending on your use case. Note, however, that you'll need a unique issuer API key for each one.

You should store the DID (`did`) and encryption and signing key pairs (`keys`) that this returns. You'll need these to issue credentials to users.

```typescript
export type TargetInfo = {
  [key: string]: any, // To be able to handle generic HTTP header requirements, i.e. version, accept, appId, etc
  url?: string // Versions denoted via a different url.
}
```

```typescript
export type VersionInfo = {
  target: TargetInfo, // The information of how to target a customer's application to communication with the corresponding Server sdkVersion.
  sdkVersion: string // Server sdk version. Ought to be in Semver notation however opting to keep a string type for simplicity.
}

Parameters:
```typescript
"apiKey": string // your issuer API key
"url": string, // the url of which UnumID's SaaS will interface with
"versionInfo": VersionInfo[] // arrays of objects for how to contact specific version of your verifier and subsequently the sever sdk. 
```

Response Body:  [**RegisteredIssuer**](https://docs.unumid.co/Server-SDK-Typescript/interfaces/registeredissuer.html)
```typescript title="RegisteredIssuer"
{
  "uuid": string, // identifies issuer in Unum ID database
  "customerUuid": string, // identifies customer in Unum ID database
  "did": string, // identifies issuer in Unum ID ecosystem
  "name": string, // human-readable name for issuer. Displayed to users in mobile apps when verifiers request credentials. Comes from the name of the ApiKey used to register the Issuer.
  "createdAt": string, // when issuer was registered
  "updatedAt": string, // when issuer was last updated
  "keys": {
    "signing": {
      "id": string, // identifies the key within the did doc. Used to specify the exact key used to create a signature.
      "privateKey": string, // you use this to create signatures on credentials
      "publicKey": string, // subjects and verifiers use this to verify your signatures on credentials
    }
    "encryption": {
      "id": string, // identifies the key within the did doc
      "privateKey": string, // not used
      "publicKey": string, // not used; but part of the issuer did doc
    }
  }
}
```

### issueCredentials
Issue a credential to a Subject, also known as a User.

You need to provide your Issuer DID (created when you registered), as well as your signing and encryption private keys, which the Issuer uses to sign and encrypt the credential. You need to specify a credential `type`, which verifiers will use to later request the credential from the user.

This returns a credential `id` that should be stored for reference. For example, the credential id is required to revoke the credential if need be. We would recommend storing the entire credential indexed on the resultant credential `id`. Note that there are also id fields within a `credentialSubject` and `credentialStatus`, but these are different. They refer to the subject DID and credential status identifier, respectively, as defined by the W3C spec [[1](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#credential-subject)],[[2](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#status)].

**Important**: The private keys never leave your app. This function, like all the others in this SDK, needs them in order to handle to cryptographic functionality on your behalf.

Parameters
```typescript
"type": string || string[], // The Credential type(s)
"issuer": string, // your issuer DID
"credentialSubject": {
  "id": string, // subject DID
  [key: string]: any, // data about subject (any valid JSON)
},
"signingPrivateKey": string // your issuer signing private key
"expirationDate"?: string, // (optional) when credential will no longer be valid (ISO 8601 date/time)
```

Response Body: [**Credential**](https://docs.unumid.co/Server-SDK-Typescript/interfaces/credential.html)
```typescript title="Credential"
{[
    "@context": ["https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1"], // for conformance with W3C Verifiable Credential spec
    "credentialStatus": {
        "id": string, // a url for credential's status
        "type": "CredentialStatus"
    },
    "credentialSubject": stringify({ // a string representation of an object with  with an id attribute and any number of arbitrary key values pairs.
        "id": string, // subject DID
        [key: string]: any, // data about subject
    }),
    "issuer": string, // issuer DID
    "type": string[], // credential type(s), always begins with "VerifiableCredential"
    "id": string, // identifies credential (version 4 UUID)
    "issuanceDate": string, // when credential was issued (ISO 8601 date/time)
    "expirationDate": string, // when credential will no longer be valid (ISO 8601 date-time)
    "proof": Proof // cryptographic proof created by signing credential with your issuer signing private key. Can be used to verify credential.
]}
```

### updateCredentialStatus
Update a credential, i.e. make it invalid.

You need to provide the credential `id` (created when you issued the credential) and a [CredentialStatusOptions](https://docs.unumid.co/types/modules.html#credentialstatusoptions) `status`. Currently the only valid status are: verified and revoked.

```typescript
export type CredentialStatusOptions = 'valid' | 'revoked';
```

Parameters
```typescript
{
  "credentialId": string // id of the credential
  "status": CredentialStatusOptions // status to update the credential to (defaults to 'revoked')
}
```

Response Body: **Empty**. If unsuccessful and exception will be thrown.
```typescript
{}
```

### revokeAllCredentials
Revoke all issued credentials to a particular DID.

You need to provide your issuer's `did` and `signingPrivateKey` also the target `subjectDid`. Only credentials issued by the associated issuer are revoked from the subject. The signing private key is necessary for the request signature to be created within the sdk. The signature is necessary to be verified by the SaaS prior to revoking all the credentials. 

Parameters
```typescript
{
  "issuerDid": string // did of the issuer of credential you would like to revoke
  "signingPrivateKey": string // issuer's signing private key
  "subjectDid": string // did of target subject whom to revoke all the credentials issued by the issuer
}
```

Response Body: **Empty**. If unsuccessful and exception will be thrown.
```typescript
{}
```

### verifySubjectCredentialRequests
Verify a Subject's requests for credentials.

You need to provide the your issuer's `did` along with the SubjectCredentialRequest array from your `/userCredentialRequest` [endpoint](https://gist.github.com/UnumIDAdmin/fd75b174b33ff0c5b4de87118cb11188).

The array of CredentialRequests are signed by the subject's private key. This function verifies the cryptographic signature is valid. Furthermore, it validates that all requests are from the same subject and that requested Issuer requirements are met. After which, your application code will need to evaluate wether it can issue the requested credentials. An example implementation can be found [here](https://github.com/UnumID/demo-issuer-server/blob/main/src/services/api/credentialRequest/credentialRequest.class.ts).

The main use case of this to allow bootstrapping users that just installed the Unum ID Wallet with credentials necessary to use across the network, i.e for instant sign ups with a partner. 

_Note_: Despite this having "verify" in its name, this function serves Issuers in determining whether a subject's request for credentials is valid. It is up to your application logic to determine whether you have the data relating to the the subject to issue the requested credentials.


```typescript
export type CredentialRequest = {
  type: string; // the string matching the desire credential type
  issuers: string[]; //list of acceptable issuer DIDs that have issued the credential
  required: boolean; // to denote wether this particular credential is required. Defaults behavior resolves this to true.
}
```

```typescript
export type SubjectCredentialRequests = {
  credentialRequests: CredentialRequests[]; // the string matching the desire credential type
  proof: Proof; // proof signed by the subject
}
```

Parameters
```typescript
{
  "issuerDid": string // the did of your issuer
  "subjectDid": string // the did of the subject
  "subjectCredentialRequests: SubjectCredentialRequests // object containing list of CredentialRequests with a Proof signed by the Subject
}
```

Response Body: [**VerifiedStatus**]. 
```typescript
export interface SubjectCredentialRequestVerifiedStatus {
  isVerified: boolean; // returns true if the requests are verified and validation requirements are met
  message?: string; // (optional) only populated iff isVerified is false
}
```

### verifySignedDid
Verify a signed Decentralized Identifier.

You need to provide the your issuer's `did` along with the signed DID object.

The DID string is signed by the subject's ECC private key. This function verifies the cryptographic signature is valid. 

The main use case is for the `/userCredentialRequests` required Issuer endpoint. It facilitates getting DID information for users within your service. The User DID is necessary to then issue re-usable identity credentials to.


```typescript
export type DID = {
  id: string; // the string matching the desire credential type
  proof: Proof; //list of acceptable issuer DIDs that have issued the credential
}
```

Parameters
```typescript
{
  "issuerDid": string // the did of your issuer
  "signedDid": DID // the signed DID object
}
```

Response Body: [**VerifiedStatus**]. 
```typescript
export interface VerifiedStatus {
  isVerified: boolean; // returns true if the signature of the DID is verified to be signed by the DID signing key
  message?: string; // (optional) only populated iff isVerified is false
}
```

## Verifier
The Verifier functionality is used by a customer acting as a verifier. Most importantly, it allows customers to send PresentationRequests to the UnumID mobile SDK and to verify the encrypted Presentation responses.

### registerVerifier
Register a verifier corresponding to your customer UUID and verifier API key that UnumID provides. As a customer, you can register as many verifiers as you like (or none at all), depending on your use case. Note, however, that you'll need a unique verifier API key for each one.

You should store the DID (`did`) and signing key pair (`keys`) that this returns. You'll need these to create requests for (presentations of) credentials from users.

```typescript
export type TargetInfo = {
  [key: string]: any, // To be able to handle generic HTTP header requirements, i.e. version, accept, appId, etc
  url?: string // Versions denoted via a different url.
}
```

```typescript
export type VersionInfo = {
  target: TargetInfo, // The information of how to target a customer's application to communication with the corresponding Server sdkVersion.
  sdkVersion: string // Server sdk version. Ought to be in Semver notation however opting to keep a string type for simplicity.
}
```

Parameters
```typescript
"apiKey": string // your verifier API key
"url": string, // the url of which UnumID's SaaS will interface with
"versionInfo": VersionInfo[] // arrays of objects for how to contact specific version of your verifier and subsequently the sever sdk. 
```

Response body: [**RegisteredVerifier**](https://docs.unumid.co/Server-SDK-Typescript/interfaces/registeredverifier.html)
```typescript title="RegisteredVerifier"
{
  "uuid": string, // identifies verifier in Unum ID database
  "customerUuid": string, // identifies customer in Unum ID database
  "did": string, // identifiers verifier in Unum ID ecosystem
  "name": string, // human-readable name for verifier. Displayed to users in mobile apps when you make requests. Comes from the name of the ApiKey used to register the Verifier.
  "createdAt": string, // when verifier was registered (ISO 8601 date/time)
  "updatedAt": string, // when verifier was last updated (ISO 8601 date/time)
  "keys": {
    "signing": {
      "id": string, // identifies the key within the did doc. Used to specify the exact key used to create a signature.
      "privateKey": string, // you use this to create signatures on requests
      "publicKey": string, // subjects use this to verify your signatures on requests
    }, "encryption": {
      "id": string, // identifies the key within the did doc
      "privateKey": string, // you use this to decrypt presentations you receive from subjects
      "publicKey": string, // subjects use this to encrypt presentations they send to you
    }
  }
```


### sendRequest
Create a request for (a presentation of) credentials from a user.

You need to provide your verifier DID (created when you registered) and the UUID of the holder app from which the user can share the data. You also need to provide your signing private key, which the SDK uses to sign the request.

**Important**: The signing private key never leaves your app. This function, like all the others in this SDK, is solely using it to handle to cryptographic functionality on your behalf.

To request credentials, you need to populate one or more [CredentialRequest](https://docs.unumid.co/types/interfaces/credentialrequest.html) objects, defined in the UnumID generic [types](https://github.com/UnumID/types/blob/00ba819e661e2856ba9909923ac6f083b9a15e85/index.d.ts#L113-L117) project and shown below.

```typescript
export interface CredentialRequest {
  type: string; // credential type. This must match type of previously issued credential.
  issuers: string[]; // list of DIDs for acceptable issuers. If multiple, any one is acceptable.
  required?: boolean; // (optional) if credential is required (default is true)
}
```
If you list more than one acceptable `issuers` (entities that issued the desired credential type), the user can share a credential issued by any of the ones listed.

Parameters
```typescript
"verifier": string, // your verifier DID
"credentialRequests": CredentialRequest[], // a list of one or more CredentialRequest objects. Encodes which credentials should be included in presentation that responds to PresentationRequest.
"signingPrivateKey": string, // your verifier signing private key
"holderAppUuid": string, // identifies mobile app subjects will share presentations from
"expiresAt"?: string, // (optional) when PresentationRequest will no longer be valid (ISO 8601 date/time). Default is 10 minutes after creation.
"metadata"?: object // (optional) any additional data to include in PresentationRequest
```

Response Body: [**PresentationRequestPostDto**](https://docs.unumid.co/types/interfaces/presentationrequestpostdto.html)
```typescript title="PresentationRequestPostDto"
{
  "presentationRequest": {
    "uuid": string, // identifies PresentationRequest in Unum ID database
    "createdAt": string, // when PresentationRequest was created (ISO 8601 date/time)
    "updatedAt": string, // when PresentationRequest was last updated (ISO 8601 date/time). Should always be same as createdAt.
    "expiresAt": string, // when PresentationRequest will no longer be valid (ISO 8601 date/time)
    "verifier": string, // your verifier DID
    "credentialRequests": CredentialRequest[], // a list of one or more CredentialRequest objects. Encodes which credentials should be included in presentation that responds to PresentationRequest.
    "proof": Proof, // acryptographic proof created by signing PresentationRequest with your verifier signing private key. Can be used to verify PresentationRequest.
    "metadata": object // any additional data to include in PresentationRequest
  },
  "verifier": {
      "name": string, // human readable name for verifier. Displayed to users in mobile apps.
      "did": string, // your verifier DID
      "url": string // endpoint you use to receive presentations
  },
  "issuers": {
      "IssuerDid:string": { // map keyed on issuer DID(s) that issued requested credential(s)
        "name": string, // human readable name for issuer
        "did": string // issuer DID
      }
  },
  "holderApp": {
    "name": string, // human readable name for holder app. Displayed to users in the Web SDK.
    "uriScheme": string, // uri scheme to create deep links to the holder app.
    "deeplinkButtonImg": string // image for the Web SDK to display as a button, encoded as a data uri
  },
  /* You send this to a user with the Web SDK: */
  "deeplink": string, // deep link (URL) that can be used to trigger intended mobile app to load PresentationRequest
  /* You display this to a user with the Web SDK */
  "qrCode": string // QR code representation of deep link (encoded as data URL)
}
```

### verifyPresentation 
Handles decrypting the encrypted presentation and verifies the signatures are valid.

You need to be able to receive presentations from users and pass them to this function. To do this, you need to create a `/presentation` endpoint that conforms to our [OpenAPI specification](https://gist.github.com/UnumIDAdmin/2bffdf092594196beba48ce7738b60fa). The Unum ID cloud sends encrypted presentations to this endpoint, which should pass those presentations to the `verifyPresentation` function to be decrypted and verified.

You need to provide:

1. your verifier did
2. your verifier encryption private key
3. encrypted presentation (received at `/presentation` endpoint)
4. (optional, but recommended) presentation request (received at `/presentation` endpoint)

The fist two are returned by [`registerVerifier`](#registerVerifier).

**Important** Although the mobile SDK sends the presentations directly to UnumID's SaaS, UnumID never has access to the credentials within the presentation. The mobile SDK encrypts all presentations with the presentation requesting verifier's public key, to which the requestor is the only ones with necessary decryption private key, the Verifier's `encryptionPrivateKey`, an attribute created with the registerVerifier call.

**Note** `presentationRequest` is optional in order for the server sdk can handle verifying presentations that may not have a corresponding request. However, if `presentationRequest` is supplied from UnumID's SaaS via the `/presentation` endpoint, it is strongly recommended that it is provided as it performs additional validation checks on your behalf.

Parameters
```typescript
"encryptedPresentation": EncryptedData, // encrypted presentation
"verifierDid": string, // your verifier DID
"encryptionPrivateKey": string // your verifier encryption private key
"presentationRequest"?: PresentationRequestDto // (optional) presentation request dto object to verify presentation credentials meet request requirements. This is an optional param to support the future use case of handling verifying presentations that are not in response to PresentationRequest
```


Response Body: [**DecryptedPresentation**](https://docs.unumid.co/Server-SDK-Typescript/interfaces/decryptedpresentation.html)
```typescript title="DecryptedPresentation"
{
  "isVerified": boolean; // whether the presentation is valid
  "type": 'VerifiablePresentation' | 'DeclinedPresentation' // type of presentation. DeclinedPresentation means user declined request and the submitted presentation's VerifiableCredential attribute was undefined or an empty array.
  "presentation": Presentation, // decrypted Presentation object
  "message"?: string; // (optional) included if isVerified is false. Explains why verification failed.
}
```

### sendSms
Use to send a deep link to a user by SMS. A templated message will be delivered from an UnumID associated phone number. You can of course use your own SMS sending service if you prefer.

To request (a presentation of) credentials from a user, you first create the request object and receive a deep link that references it. The user need to receive this deep link, which will open the correct app on their phone and prompt them to share the credentials. SMS is one convenient channel.

The SMS message will be in the format:
- Verification Request: [verifier_name]. Click here to complete: [deep_link]

**Note**: The verifier is corresponding to the presentation request from which the deeplink references. Because you are the acting verifier, the name will be what ever you provided during [verifier registration](#registerVerifier). 

Parameters
```typescript
{
  "to": string, // phone number to send SMS to
  "deeplink": string // the deeplink corresponding to the presentation request you would like served to the user
}
```

Response Body: **Empty**. If unsuccessful and exception will be thrown.
```typescript
{}
```

### sendEmail
Use to send a deep link to a user by email. A templated message will be delivered from no-reply@unumid.co. You can of course use your own email sending service if you prefer.

To request (a presentation of) credentials from a user, you first create the request object and receive a deep link that references it. The user need to receive this deep link, which will open the correct app on their phone and prompt them to share the credentials. Email is one convenient channel, though keep in mind that the user will need to click the link from their phone for the deep link to work.

The email will be in the format:
  - *subject:* Verification Request: [verifier_name]
  - *body:* Click here to complete: [deep_link]

**Note**: The verifier is corresponding to the presentation request from which the deeplink references. Because you are the acting verifier, the name will be what ever you provided during [verifier registration](#registerVerifier). 

Parameters
```typescript
{
  "to": string, // email address to send email to
  "deeplink": string // the deeplink corresponding to the presentation request you would like served to the user
}
```

Response Body: **Empty**. If unsuccessful and exception will be thrown.
```typescript
{}
```

### checkCredentialStatuses
Used to check the status of individual credentials. 

The `status` attribute of the response's [CredentialStatusInfo](https://docs.unumid.co/types/interfaces/credentialstatusinfo.html) is of type [CredentialStatusOptions](https://docs.unumid.co/types/modules.html#credentialstatusoptions). Currently the only valid status are: verified and revoked.

```typescript
export type CredentialStatusOptions = 'valid' | 'revoked';
```

```typescript
export type CredentialStatusInfo {
  "createdAt": Date; // the time  the credential was recorded as created in the UnumID SaaS db
  "updatedAt": Date; // the time  the credential was recorded as updated in the UnumID SaaS db
  "credentialId": string; // the did (aka id) of the credential this status is in regard to
  "status": CredentialStatusOptions; // a string literal type that currently only consists of 'valid' and 'revoked'
}
```

Parameters
```typescript
{
  "credentialIds": string[], // the array of ids of the credentials in question
}
```

Response Body: **CredentialIdToStatusMap**. If unsuccessful and exception will be thrown.
```typescript
{
  [credentialId: string]: CredentialStatusInfo;
}
```
